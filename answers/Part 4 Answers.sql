#Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

#Pokemon Name	Trainer Name	Level	Primary Type	Secondary Type
#Pokemon's name	Trainer's name	Current Level	Primary Type Name	Secondary Type Name
#Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer.
#You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.

with a whopping 168 total pokemon level.
